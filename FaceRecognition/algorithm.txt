while(true)
    Detect Faces (regardless of method)
    check if number of Faces changed comparing to last frame
        identify faces (multiple faces ?) --> check if one matches DB
        send update
    else
        do not send update

--> implement this! --> Maybe save person name on buttonpress


Things to consider:

Pipeline:
- Face Detection
- Normalization
- Face Identification

Which Library for Face Detection/Normalization:
- face_recognition
- deepface --> which wrapper ?

Which Library for Face Identification ? --> generate Face embedding

How to store Face Embedding ?
- Database
- In memory

How to determine match ?
- Single Match
- Take multiple images
    - KNN
    - SVM
    - store average/median image

What is crutial for timing:
- Detect Face
- Normalization
- calculate embedding
